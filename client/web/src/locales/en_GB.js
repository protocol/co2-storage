				"about-description-4": "With IPLD DAGs, data is content addressed using IPFS, meaning the URI pointing to a piece of data (“ipfs://…”) is completely unique to that data (using a", 
				"about-description-5": ", or CID). CIDs can be used for environmental assets and metadata to ensure the asset forever actually refers to the intended data (eliminating things like double counting, and making it trustlessly verifiable what content an asset is associated with). These standard, content addressed, data schemas will also enable more seamless cross-referencing for missing data and meta-analysis of different assets/credits, as well as help expedite the development of new forms of methodologies, supply, and marketplaces.",
